I'm taking an extended break from writing here.

For most of 2021, I didn't write at all. In 2022, I wanted to be productive.
That hasn't happened, obviously. I don't really think that this matters. 
This is a "blog" after all, not a useful site for detailed information.

While it is counterintuitive to some degree - I could simply stop posting and
not say _anything_ - my belief is that someone out there might see this and
benefit.


You don't have to be anyone or anything other than yourself.


You don't have to sacrifice your personal health for your job or passion.


You don't have to suffer from burnout.


*You can take a break.*
