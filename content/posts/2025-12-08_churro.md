Today, we lost our oldest kitty baby, Churro. And I feel compelled to tell you
all about her.

It feels way too early to write something like this, but I'm pretty emotional
as you can imagine, and I can't focus on anything else. So here we are.

# how she became a Martinez

~13 years ago, I was driving in a different part of Fresno, close to where we lived
at the time. I can't recall _why_ I was over there, but the important part is that
as I was heading home, I saw a little kitten in the middle of the road - stuck in
the median. I _do_ remember thinking "it's just a cat, they'll be fine", but traffic
was pretty heavy, and ultimately I called my wife and told her I was going to grab
a kitten out of traffic.

By the time I had made a u-turn, she was on the opposite side of the street. So
I ran across the street despite the traffic, "chased" after her through a field,
and ended up in a ditch. It took a minute to catch her - and she wasn't too happy
about it. I ended up with some scratches, and she literally shit on my arm. 

But she was just a little kitten, and I could not just leave her there.

She was tiny, and clearly hadn't been around people or other cats, so when I brought
her home, my wife had to literally teach her how to eat kibble. She had to do it
several times, so much so that eventually she _expected_ someone to watch her eat
for several months. It was as adorable as it sounds, basically being called for dinner
as a servant.

Anyway.. I don't remember how we settled on Churro as a name. Churros are great, and
so was she.

That first night, I slept on the couch with her to keep her company.


# bonding

Churro very quickly bonded and became enamored with my wife, for obvious reasons _and_
the fact that my wife is the Cat Whisperer or something - cats always love her and come
to her whenever we go anywhere. (Yes, I am jealous of this.)

Churro grew up with my son - he was very young at the time, and she _loved_ him, probably
as much as she loved my wife.

Churro also grew up with our dog Luna, who passed away a few years ago. I think she made
Luna more of a cat than a dog.

At the time, Churro didn't care much for me. I've always loved cats, but I guess I just wasn't
cat-dad material. I loved her, I am sure she loved me to some degree, but when you have
the Cool Mom and Cool Son, do you need more?!


# huntress

Churro became an inside-outside cat. During the day, she would go off and do whatever
it is she wanted to do. More often than not, it was hunting.

Despite wearing a collar with a bell, Churro was a prolific huntress.

Frequently, we'd open our front door or back sliding glass door and have presents. Rat tails,
entrails, birds big and small, lizards, and other things I'm probably not remembering.
She was just _that_ good at catching stuff, and we've always joked about how we miss the presents.

At one point she became an inside-only cat...


# grand adventure? and the meantime

The last time we moved, we kept Churro mostly inside in the beginning. It wasn't long
after we started letting her out that she just didn't come home in the evening
like she usually did.

We assumed she'd come home in a few days. It wasn't the first time, but I think it felt
different because of us being in a different house, on the other side of town.

When she was gone for a significant amount of time, we put up signs. We crossed our fingers,
hoping that she would just turn up as if she'd never been gone.

Months went by.

When visiting my MIL, I saw a young cat that looked a lot like Churro. I cried. We brought her
home and named her Valentine. (Yes, it was Valentine's. Duh.)

Eventually, someone called the number on our poster, thinking that they had found Churro.
It wasn't her, but she was so sweet, that I begged my wife to let me bring her home. Her name
is Waffle, and she is 100% the boss of me.

We received a kitty from a friend and named her Jolene.

All this time, I just _knew_ Churro was out there, probably preying on pesky rats, birds,
or chilling in someone else's house. She was _SMART_ and there was no fucking way that
she got hurt.


# homecoming

I was in a meeting one day - standup, I think - and my phone rang. I almost _never_ answer
my phone - I have a ton of missed calls, voicemails, and texts that I just don't read or respond
to. But I had a feeling that I _had to answer this call_. So I did.

It was a vet's office. Someone had brought in a cat, they had scanned the microchip on her, and
it was Churro. The person who brought her in, interestingly enough, had found her roughly on
the side of town that we _used_ to live. I like to think that she just got confused and decided
to "go home", thinking of the old place. She was so fucking smart that I don't doubt she
could have made it despite the distance and roads.

My wife and I got there as fast as we could.

As soon as we opened the door to the room she was in, Churro began doing her signature 'honking',
trying to reach my wife from the cage she was in.

After almost _two years_, Churro had been found, and was back home with us.

> Home again, almost 2 years later!
![sleepy baby](/churro/home.jpg)

She had messed up her nose even more than before (from fighting her prey!), had sores on her back
and head, but she was _home_, she was _safe_.

For obvious reasons, she became an inside-only cat, despite her best attempts to convince
us otherwise.


# home again, new bonds

Our little family had grown a lot, kitty-wise. Churro was apprehensive - but not really
outwardly aggressive. She liked her personal space with the other cats, except with
Johnny and Waffle (for the most part). I don't think she cared much - there's plenty of room
for all of these dorks, and she still got the attention she wanted.

Perhaps 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' also works on cats, because for the first time
in Churro's life, she _loved_ me like I loved her. She was aggressive for attention - forcing
you to pet her, rubbing her teeth / scent on you, capitalizing lap-time and giving the stink-eye
to other cats if they tried to get close to you while _she_ was having attention-time.

It truly made happy.

She was a good kitty. She loved us, we love her.

# silly behaviors

Churro always honked instead of meowing. 'Honk honk honk'. We say it out loud, and
probably won't stop doing it.

She liked to stretch one of her arms across you if she was on your lap or stomach.
She'd dig her claws in, usually just enough to hurt - but you let her do it, because
she was cute.

She always ate a distance away from the other cats, except Johnny. He was the only
cat she _liked_, I think. She tolerated Waffle. But the others she wanted space from.
To me, it always looked like she was _observing_ the others.

Before she became an inside-only cat, you knew to expect something on the porch
if she came home with her nose scratched up, and it was pretty scarred.

She would occasionally bob her head back and forth just like those bobblehead figurines.
No idea why, but it was cute as hell.

Any time she slept in the office, she curled up like a little shrimp.

She loved her donut blanket - if it wasn't on the floor, she was much less likely
to sprawl out there. If you sprayed cat nip on it, she would go nuts, flipping all
over the place like a fish out of water.

# ... now

I feel like an idiot. I know that cats don't all live to be 20 years, but she had
always been a fighter. I thought we had more time. I thought she was going to
be a senior-senior cat by the time she had to go. I never thought that yesterday was
going to be the last time I would hold her, watch her sleep in the window-bed next to me,
have her sit on my lap. Hear her 'honk, honk, honk' that she would do all the time instead
of meowing.

She might have been "just" a cat, and maybe folks that don't have animals don't get it,
or maybe I'm just too sensitive. But Churro was _family_, a presence not to be denied.
My son grew up with her around, from barely going to school to almost being out of school.

_I_ grew up, too. I _think_ I have become more mature, or generally 'better' than I used
to be. She was there for some of that, and maybe that's why she gave me so much love when she
came home. She knew I was ready for that?

But today, I woke up to my wife crying, and Churro gone. 

Just like that, in a span of a few hours, she went from curled up on the couch to the Great Land for Kitties Beyond.


# adieu...

My head canon is that she's hunting pterodactyls or small t-rex-s. Enjoying
the start of her next nine-lives, as my wife has said.

**Churro, we love you, we miss you already, and we will never, ever forget you.**
